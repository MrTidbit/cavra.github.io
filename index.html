	<h2>Howdy!</h2>

	<p>First off, let me introduce myself. I am a Junior Computer Science Major at Texas A&M University, interested in software development. My University's website can be found <a href= "https://www.tamu.edu/">here</a>, and my Github account can be found <a href= "https://github.com/cavra">here</a>. I hope that by taking the opportunity to publish a website here, I be able to learn a few things about HTML development. I created this website as a project for my ISYS 209 class. As a computer scientist, I am familiar with developing HTML, and I find it enjoyable. I made this website by following the guidelines given. It starts off with the typical HTML page markers, such as !DOCTYPE and the html tag. I titled it with my name, Cory Avra, followed by ISYS website. I set the color scheme to a aesthetically pleasing blue and lighter gray-blue.</p>

	<p>Once the initial setup was complete, I could move on to the tricker code. I set up the template code for all three pages. I also set up links to the other pages, making sure the current page was inactive. All of this is centered and separated by horizontal lines for visually pleasing purposes. It also helps organize the content, which comes next above the footer. The content is this body paragraph here and my profile picture above. The footer is below and contains a link to an email that I do not own. All of this is centered and placed inside the main body table. Overall, I am pleased with my work. If you want to follow me and my activities, you can find me on <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/">FaceBook</a> and <a href = "https://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</p>
