    		<h1>Cory Avra's Biography</h1>
		</header>

		<h1>Howdy! My name is Cory Avra, and I'm a 3rd year Junior Computer Science Major!</h1>

		<img style="border:5px double black;" src="profile_pic.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Profile Picture">

		<p>First off, let me apologize for the simple website - I am just beginning to get into web development! I hope that by taking the opportunity to publish my bio here, I be able to learn a few things about coding in HTML.</p>

		<p>A few things about myself - I love all things outdoors. I'm an avid camper and backpacker, and I just recently returned from a trip to Caprock Canyons with some friends for New Year's Eve (Beautiful State Park in the panhandle). I also enjoy activities such as skydiving and biking, but I'd love to one day get into scuba diving and bungee jumping.</p>

		<p>Regarding this class, I've always had a fascination with computers for as long as I can remember. I have a bit of experience developing iOS applications, and I'd love to continue developing them in my spare time. I registered for this course to be able to learn the necessary techniques to create a positive user experience, so that when I develop future applications or websites, I'll be able to provide a better overall experience. Obviously, anything I learn will also benefit me with my career, especially if I go into any sort of front-end software development.</p>

		<p>As a Junior, I've accumulated a decently-sized list of computer-related courses. In addition to the required 121, 181, 221, 222, 312, 313, 314, 315, and 411 courses, I'm also (currently) taking Computers and Network Security (465) and some business classes, since I'm getting a Business Minor. The Business classes are Accounting, Information Systems, and Marketing.</p>

		<p>I've actually never had any internships or relevant jobs, but I'm hoping to get an internship this summer!</p>
